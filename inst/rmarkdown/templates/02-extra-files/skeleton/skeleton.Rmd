## About

Update this to provide instructions for the code.

## Clear the environment

```{r, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Customising the features

The custom CSS has been used to change the style of the tables in the document.

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "A custom table style")
```

## load up the packages required

Add any packages to the `packages` object

```{r, include=FALSE}
packages <- c('clipr', 'ARTofR')

for (package in packages) {
  if (!require(package, character.only = TRUE)) {
    message(paste("Installing package:", package))
    install.packages(package, dependencies = TRUE) # Install if not available
    library(package, character.only = TRUE)        # Load after installation
  } else {
    message(paste("Loaded package:", package))
  }
}
```
## Sourcing external R Files

The files should be saved in the `R` file. See https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/source-script.html for information

```{r, include=FALSE, load-multiple-scripts}
# # 1. List only the scripts you want (just the filenames, no path)
# selected <- c("script1.R", "script2.R", "script3.R")
# 
# # 2. Set the folder so we get "R/script1.R", etc.
# scripts <- file.path("R", selected)
# 
# # 3. Source each one into your knit environment
# for (f in scripts) {
#   source(f, local = knitr::knit_global())
# }
```

## Creating a directory 

If you look at the file `inst/rmarkdown/templates/02-extra-files/templates.yaml`, you will see the following line:

```
create_dir: true
```

This means that a new directory will be created when the template is selected. This will copy over the content of the folder `inst/rmarkdown/templates/02-extra-files/skeleton`to the directory selected.

## Example features

The custom CSS has been used to change the style of the tables in the document.

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "A custom table style")
```

## Customisation

You may want to consider making the following changes

- altering the style.css file to change the style of the table
- Add your own logo to the header by replacing the `logo.png` file.

## Limitations

You may notice that this kind of template requires the external files to be in the same working directory as the R Markdown file. This can make the file less portable, and also can become frustrating if you want to have lots of additional files.

You may overcome this limitation by creating a custom R Markdown format. This allows us to reference to files contained directly within your custom template package. To see an example of this, check out template 5.
